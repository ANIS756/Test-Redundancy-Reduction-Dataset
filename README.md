# Test-Redundancy-Reduction-Dataset
This repository hosts datasets developed for the Test Redundancy Reduction (TRR) Optimization research project under the Faculty of Computing, Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah (UMPSA).
The datasets are designed to support experimental studies on TRR.

These datasets are primarily used to benchmark and analyze metaheuristic-based optimization algorithms such as PSO, Jaya, SCA, and SSA, including their hybrid and multi-factorial variants.

This work is part of my MSc research project supported by Abu Dhabi University and Liwa College, International  Collaborative Grant Initiative.

Please ensure appropriate acknowledgment is given when using these datasets in any publication or project.
